# Civ4 Realism Invictus: World of 2022
The following map is a modified version of the huge world map in Civ4 RI 3.61. The purpose is to create a world that models some of the current conflicts and power balances of the world at the beginning of the year 2022. 
The map does not claim to be historic, but to provide a game, where already 4000 B.C. the present conflics are built in, e.g. the Turks do not have a starting position in Caucasus, but in the current location of Turkey. Although Europe have strong nations, the space is limited and also the growth compared to Russia, China and the USA. As religions have already been set to the cilivations, it is supposed that the western countries will cooperate or at least not annihiliate each other. Russia starts weak, but has much growing potential to the east. China and USA both have much space to grow. Further, is it especially challenging to play Taiwan or Isreal.

Starting from this map, a goal is to let the AI play with itself to populate the whole map to look like the world of today and then to create a World of 2022 scenario of it. Modifications could be made to start with the modern era and military strength could be modeled for a modern scenario.

The map was built and tested in the world builder with Civ4 RI 3.61 r5422 [Download here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/civ4mods/).

Please feel free to improve the map and propose improvements!

## Modifications to Huge World map of Civ4 RI
- The north passage is open to travel with costal ships to make better access to settlements in the north
- America can be reached with costal ships to make faster contact and interaction
- Most native, minor civilizations were reduced or removed and replaced by major, playable civilizations and barbarians to accelerate the conquests by the major nations
- All main civilizations have already received their main religions, to make it easier to form alliances between e.g. european countries
- To prevent the civs from destroying each other too early, each capital has a tribal fort inside
- The location of the Argentinians are replaced by the Dutch
- The location of the Palestinians are replaced by the Nubians
- The location of North Korea is replaced by the South Chinese
- The location of Canada is replaced by the Celts

## Possible Further Improvements
- With ai autoplay (game.aiplay xxx) fill the map with cities and units and then put current military strength as units on the map
- Add additional nations and personalities, e.g. Argentinian or North Korean.
- Realistic city names
- Add preset diplomatic relations between the West, the Eurasic axis, the shia and sunny moslem world, the African and South American countries
