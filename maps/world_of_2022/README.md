# Civ4 RI Map World of 2022
The following map is a modified version of the World map huge in Civ4 RI 3.61. The purpose is to create a world that is a little bit more similar to the current conflicts and alliances of 2022. The purpose of the map is 
to create a scenario where the current power balance of the world is modeled. The map does not have the claim to be historic, but to provide a game, where already 4000 B.C. the present conflics are built in. From this map,
modifications could be made to start with the modern era and where military strength is modeled in a modern scenario.

## Modifications to the standard World Map
- Argentinians are replaced by the Dutch
- Palestinians are replaced by the Nubians
- North Korea is replaced by the South Chinese
- The north passage is open to travel with costal ships
- America can be reached with costal ships
- All main civilizations have already received their religions of 2022, to make alliances between e.g. euopean countries easier
- To prevent the civs from destroing each other too early, each capital has a tribal fort

## Possible Improvements
- With ai autoplay (game.aiplay xxx) fill the map with cities and units and then put current military strength as units on the map
- Add additional nations and personalities, e.g. Argentinian or North Korean.
- Realistic city names
