# Civ4 RI Map World of 2022
The following map is a modified version of the World map huge in Civ4 RI 3.61. The purpose is to create a world that models some of the current conflicts and power balance of the world at the beginning of the year 2022. 
The map does not claim to be historic, but to provide a game, where already 4000 B.C. the present conflics are built in. 

From this map, modifications could be made to start with the modern era and where military strength is modeled in a modern scenario.

## Modifications to the standard World Map
- The north passage is open to travel with costal ships to make more settlementsin the north
- America can be reached with costal ships to make faste contact and interaction
- All main civilizations have already received their religions of 2022, to make it easier to form alliances between e.g. euopean countries
- To prevent the civs from destroing each other too early, each capital has a tribal fort
- The location of the Argentinians are replaced by the Dutch
- The location of the Palestinians are replaced by the Nubians
- The location of North Korea is replaced by the South Chinese

## Possible Improvements
- With ai autoplay (game.aiplay xxx) fill the map with cities and units and then put current military strength as units on the map
- Add additional nations and personalities, e.g. Argentinian or North Korean.
- Realistic city names
- Add preset diplomatic relations between the West, the Eurasic axis, the shia and sunny moslem world, the African and South American countries
